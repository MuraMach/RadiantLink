# White Paper: Radiant Secure Messaging Protocol (RSMP)

# Abstract

The Radiant Secure Messaging Protocol (RSMP) leverages the advanced scripting capabilities of the Radiant blockchain to deliver a state-of-the-art, secure messaging solution. By integrating sophisticated cryptographic methods, including zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, RSMP provides a robust framework for real-time, confidential communication. This document outlines the key features, cryptographic foundations, and implementation strategies of RSMP.

# 1. Introduction

# 1.1 Radiant Blockchain

Radiant extends Bitcoin Cash with enhanced scripting capabilities, allowing complex smart contracts and advanced cryptographic operations. RSMP capitalizes on these features to provide secure, efficient messaging.

# 1.2 RSMP Goals

RSMP aims to offer:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secures messages from sender to receiver using advanced cryptographic methods.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Facilitates instant messaging with minimal latency.
- **Key Management**: Integrates secure key exchange without third parties.

# 2. Cryptographic Foundations

# 2.1 Advanced Cryptographic Methods

- **Post-Quantum Algorithms**: Utilizes algorithms like FrodoKEM and SIKE for quantum-resistant key exchange.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Employs zk-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs for privacy-preserving proofs.
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Uses HEAAN and CKKS to enable computations on encrypted data.

# 2.2 Radiant-Specific Enhancements

- **OP_SHA512_256**: Provides strong cryptographic hashing.
- **OP_STATESEPARATOR**: Separates state and code in contracts for efficient execution.
- **Prefix Tries**: Enables efficient name resolution and message indexing.

# 3. Protocol Features

# 3.1 Real-Time Messaging

RSMP supports real-time communication by using zk-Rollups for scalability and multi-channel communication to handle high data throughput.

# 3.2 Secure Key Exchange

- **On-Chain Key Exchange**: Employs post-quantum cryptographic methods for secure, decentralized key exchange.
- **Multi-Party Computation**: Facilitates secure key sharing among multiple parties.

# 3.3 Message Obfuscation

- **Confidential Transactions**: Uses cryptographic commitments to conceal transaction details.
- **Enhanced Range Proofs**: Provides compact proofs for value ranges to maintain privacy.

# 4. Implementation on Radiant

# 4.1 Contract Development

1. **Define Contracts**: Create contracts using Radiant’s advanced opcodes to manage messaging logic and key management.
2. **Utilize Prefix Tries**: Implement prefix tries for efficient name resolution and message indexing.

# 4.2 Practical Considerations

- **Scalability**: Ensure protocol scalability with increasing data volumes.
- **Security**: Regularly update cryptographic methods to address new threats.
- **Performance**: Optimize contract execution for low-latency communication.

# 5. Conclusion

RSMP sets a new standard for secure messaging by combining Radiant’s scripting power with advanced cryptographic techniques. This protocol ensures confidential, real-time communication with robust key management and message obfuscation.
